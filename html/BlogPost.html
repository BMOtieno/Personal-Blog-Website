                    <h1>Who is Brian?</h1>
                    <p><small>May 17, 2022 by <b><em><u>Brian</u></em></b></small></p>
                    <p>I am a restless polymath who is constantly looking for new growth curves.</p>
                    Again, who am I? I self identify as an ambitious person who always clings to the notion<br>
                    that "if the sky is the limit then why did we land on the moon?"<br>
                    <p class="parag">I am a senior and computer science is my major.</p> 
                    <p>I have a fascination with coding and I like developing disruptive technologies.</p> 
                    <p>I am always keen on working on innovative ideas that will revolutionize modern society.<br>
                    I am never the one to make wishes on a shooting star, for if wishes were horses<br>
                    then beggars would ride to <s>heaven</s> Valhalla.</p> 
                    <p>I don't see Odin giving me a billion dollars only a reality check.</p>

                    <h2>What do I love to do?</h2>
                    <p>Before the pandemic, I volunteered in the Pleasantville Homework program,<br>
                    where volunteers would help children from low-income households with their math and<br>
                    science homework.I took this chance to mentor some of the children in the program.<br>
                    The kids could identify me as one of their own because we both share a similar background.<br>
                    I would use that trust to be able to educate them on the perks of having a positive mind<br>
                    towards math and the benefits that are in STEM careers.<br> 
                    <p>To nurture that interest, I would use my phone to teach them how to write simple programs<br>
                    such as displaying "Hello World" to the console window using <b>python</b> language.</p>
                    Via such exercises, I was able to keep them interested in learning to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"><b>code</b></a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>During my free time I like to do the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Watch Anime</li>
                            <li>Listen to music on Spotify</li>
                            <li>Play Fortnite</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>One of my all time favorite quote:</h5>
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes">
                        “If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.”
                        ― Mark Twain

                    <h2>What are my struggles?</h2>
                    <p>I believe the root cause of excluded groups from the field of technology is the growing<br> 
                    inequality in wealth and access to resources, which in turn influences their marginalization<br>
                    from STEM careers. I can illustrate from my own experiences.</p>
                    <p> I got my first laptop at age twenty-one, and it was my first-time gaining access to a computer.</p>
                    <p>Something that is in stark contrast to my peers who were brought up with computers<br>
                    in their households and had the opportunity to use them in conjunction with their parents'<br>
                    iPhones and iPads. That being only the tip of the iceberg, they also got the added advantage<br>
                    of going to schools that provided programming lessons at an early age. Therefore, a person<br>
                    from a humble background such as myself ends up getting disillusioned because<br>
                    I am beginning to learn to program in college as my peers are already familiar<br>
                    with at least two programming languages.</p>
                    Without any role model and mentor, dropping out seems to be an appealing option.<br>
                    <p class="parag">However, being the resilient <em>honey badger</em> that I am, I always strive to grasp any new concept.</p>
                    <p>If it is difficult at first, I do not let it discourage me from achieving my goal.<br>
                    That is to become a software engineer. To address the mentioned challenge,<br>
                    I took it upon myself to first learn the fundamental principles of coding in <b>Java</b> and to practice<br>
                    more so that I become equipped to creating simple functioning programs.<br>
                    Then share what I have learned with my colleagues or anyone interested in coding.</p>
                    <p>How I cope when the going gets tough:
                        <ol>
                            <li>I always remind myself that every cloud has a silver lining</li>
                            <li>I always talk to my mother, she is my number one supporter and always encourages me</li>
                            <li>I take my time to pray and meditate</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
